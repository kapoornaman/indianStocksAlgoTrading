### Equal-Weight Nifty50 Index Fund

The NIFTY 50 is a benchmark Indian stock market index that represents the weighted average of 50 of the largest Indian companies listed on the National Stock Exchange. Nifty 50 is owned and managed by NSE Indices, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the NSE Strategic Investment Corporation Limited.

The goal of this project is to create a Python script that will accept the value of your portfolio and tell you how many shares of each Nifty50 constituent you should purchase to get an equal-weight version of the index fund.

The project is inspired from the help of algorithmic-trading-python by Nick Mccullum and with the help of youtube channel Financial Programming with Ritvik, CFA
